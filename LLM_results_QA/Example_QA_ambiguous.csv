2617,A deer is on the right of an umbrella.,['right'],"Explanation: Based on the frame of reference (external intrinsic), the spatial relation ""on the right of"" is determined by the intrinsic direction of the umbrella, assuming it has a defined front and back. Since the intrinsic direction of the umbrella is not explicitly described, we rely on the assumption that the umbrella has a front and back. Therefore, the deer is on the right side of the umbrella based on the umbrella's intrinsic direction, not the camera's perspective. However, the question asks for the camera's perspective, which would require an external relative frame of reference. Without explicit information about the camera's perspective, we cannot definitively determine the spatial relation from the camera's viewpoint. 

Answer: right"
2618,A chicken is on the left of a fire hydrant.,['left'],"Explanation: Based on the frame of reference (external relative), the spatial relation ""on the left of"" is determined by an implied external perspective, which in this case is likely the camera's perspective.

## Dataset Creation
### Pipeline
![Pipeline for creating FoREST](figures/pipeline.gif)
Pipeline for dataset creation, starting from selecting a locatum and relatum from available objects and then applying a spatial template to generate the spatial expression (T). 
FoRs are assigned based on the relatumâ€™s properties. T is then categorized based on the number of FoRs.
For example, *A cat is to the right of a dog.* (with two possible FoRs: external intrinsic and external relative) belongs to the A-split. 
Then, its disambiguated version (*A cat is to the right of a dog from the dog's perspective*) is added to the C-split. Next, if applicable, a relatum's orientation is included for visualization and question generation. 
Finally, Unity3D generates scene configurations, and question-answer pairs are created from T.

### Relatum Properties for Frame of Reference Cases

We provide the relatum properties used for create each Frame of Reference case below (*Note that the images are only for visualization*),

### Visualization

The visualization is created separately using the Unity3D engine. **Instructions for running this are awaited for updating.**

Examples of synthetic visualization associated with generated examples are provided below,

## Task Evaluation

We utilize the FoREST benchmark to evaluate three tasks. 
The two main tasks focus on spatial reasoning: question-answering (QA) and text-to-image (T2I).
All evaluation tasks can be found below,

### [Question-Answering (QA).](question-answering/README.md)
### [Text-to-Image Generation (T2I).](text-to-image/README.md)
### [FoR Identification.](FoR-Identification/README.md)
